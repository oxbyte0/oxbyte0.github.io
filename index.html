        <h2>Advanced Description</h2>
        <p>The blog is structured as a <strong>technical knowledge base</strong>, covering both 
        <strong>offensive and defensive security practices</strong>.</p>
        <p>Posts range from <strong>in-depth attack simulations and exploitation walkthroughs</strong> to 
        <strong>blue team methodologies such as log analysis, detection engineering, and incident response</strong>.</p>

        <p>Every article is designed to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide <strong>clear technical steps and methodology</strong>.</li>
